Soundation, amplified.

## Quick Install
Download from the Chrome Webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modation/mceoomlpmmmghcdfammgcjnhdnnambef

## What is it?
Modation is an extension for Google's Chrome web browser that extends community functionality for Soundation, an online collaborative music studio. This extension adds a button to the Chrome toolbar for easy access to all notifications on your Soundation account. When you receive a new message or group invitation, a number will appear on the added toolbar button, and a desktop notification will appear on your screen.

## Why do I need it?
The Soundation Community is a tremendous feature, and one of the best parts of the site. One thing it lacks is a truly practical notifications system. The site will display a summary of new messages, follows, invitations, and memberships, but these are visible only within the site. Modation has the ability to pull these updates on a regular basis and instantly alert you of changes.

## What about privacy?
This extension knows who you are on Soundation. **Thatâ€™s it.** In no way does it track, store, record, upload, or save any personally identifiable information about your use, nor will it ever in the foreseeable future. The only tracking that may occur would be performed by Google itself, and is detailed in their [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). I want to respect the privacy of all users, so the usage of this extension is anonymous and will stay that way.
